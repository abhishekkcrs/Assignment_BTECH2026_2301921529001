# OOPS

1) Box problem
  Design a class named Box whose dimensions are integers and private to the class. The dimensions are labelled: length , breadth , and height .

The default constructor of the class should initialize l,b,h.

The parameterized constructor Box(int length, int breadth, int height) should initialize Box's length, breadth and height.

The copy constructor BoxBox respectively.

Apart from the above, the class should have  functions:

int getLength() - Return box's length
int getBreadth() - Return box's breadth
int getHeight() - Return box's height
long long CalculateVolume() - Return the volume of the box
Overload the operator < for the class Box to compare 2 boxes:

Overload operator  << for the class Box().
